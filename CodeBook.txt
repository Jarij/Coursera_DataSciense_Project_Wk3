Files used from original Data SET:

 The files that will be used to load data are listed in the order mentioned in the readme.txt-file:
 - 'activity_labels.txt'	: Link between the class labels and activity names
 - 'X_train.txt'		      : Training set
 - 'y_train.txt'		      : Training labels
 - 'X_test.txt'		        : Test set
 - 'y_test.txt'		        : Test labels
 - 'subject_train.txt'	: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample.
 
 logical descriptive names : Features, Activity and Subject.
 
 FEATURES
 features_Test_Data = X_test.txt of the original data set
 features_Train_Data = X_train.txt
 
 ACTIVITIES
 activity_Test_Dat = Y_test.txt
 activity_Train_Data = Y_train.txt
 
 SUBJECTS
 subject_Train_Data = subject_train.txt
 subject_Test_Data = subject_test.txt
 
 MERGED FILES
 FEATURE FILES:  features_Data  -- features_Test_Data AND features_Train_Data
 ACTIVITY FILES: activity_Data  -- activity_Test_Data AND activity_Train_Data
 SUBJECT FILES:  subject_Data   -- subject_Train_Data AND subject_Test_Data
 
 Variable files:
 names_features_Data = features.txt from original data set
 Column V2 is the important one
 Activity_Data column is named as Activity
 subject_Data column is named as Subject
 
 Final Data-Frame:
 combined_Data = activity_Data AND subject_Data
 My_Data = features_Data AND combined_Data
 
 subdata_names_features_Data = only mean values collected from names_features_Data$V2
 selected_Names = "Subject" AND "Activity"
 My_final_Data = subset of My_Data where only Subject and Activity are selected
 
 Labels = activity_labels.txt from the original Data set
